# compliance

Open-source software has been used in various industries, and the compliance issue of open-source software development and use has been paid more attention. Based on the lifecycle and use scope of open source software, open source compliance is classified into **license compliance, copyright compliance, patent compliance, export control compliance, GDPR compliance, bussiness secret compliance, and trademark compliance**. The SIG focuses on compliance research and provides the research results to the community for open source compliance management through tools.

#### License Compliance Background Introduction


OpenEuler is an open source OS community and uses the Mulan V2 license. Multiple downstream commercial companies have developed commercial releases based on OpenEuler. OpenEuler integrates tens of thousands of open source projects of the upstream open source community, which use various licenses. Check whether the OpenEuler Mulan V2 license  is incompatible with the open source license of these upstream projects. wether the license is incompatible or not, a series of rules and tools are required to resolve the incompatibility issue. For example:

- Resolve the file-level license problem. Example: PHP
- The problem of determining the license of the newly introduced component is resolved.
- Resolved the problem that the license of the upstream component changes. Example: mangoDB and ES
- Resolved the problem that the license of the spec file in the RPM package is inconsistent with that of the native community. Example: greenlet

#### Export Control Compliance Introduction


We hope that the SIG can develop rules that meet the community, build the rules into processes, implement these rules through tools and engineering methods, and provide solutions or services to organizations and individuals participating in the community.
